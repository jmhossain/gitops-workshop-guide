# CP4I Capabilities - Use Case walkthrough

## 1. Self-healing

In this section of the lab, we see how RedHat OpenShift performs self healing when a pod is deleted. 

To delete the pod, login to your cluster with your IBMid by browsing to the `OpenShift web console` (*see your environment assignment e-mail for the link to your ROKS Cluster URL*).  From the administrator section menu on the left, clink on the `Workload` drop down menu and click on Pods, and at the top, select the `tools` project.  Select one of the `ibm-sfg-b2bi-sfg` pods to delete and end of the row, click the vertical dot menu and click delete.

After the pod is deleted, the pod is reinstantiated and processing work as part of the deployed Sterling B2B Integrator cluster.

    >ðŸ’¡ **NOTE**     
    > While the pod is being terminated a new pod is being created.
    > If you delete on one of the pods or it crashes Openshift will automatically create a new pod to replace the problem pod
